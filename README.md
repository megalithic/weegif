#### Gimme all the gifs

So this is a ruby script for Weechat that utilizes imgcat and iTerm2-nightly
(aka iTerm3) to render images inline for a public or private chat buffer.

It is definitely still very much in alpha, as it doesn't exactly render images
yet. There are no tests, and it doesn't guard against much. I'm just working towards
happy path because I want to be able to use it asap!
